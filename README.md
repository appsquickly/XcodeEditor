# Description

An API for manipulating Xcode project files. 

# Usage

## Adding Source Files to a Project


```objective-c
Project* project = [[Project alloc] initWithFilePath:@"MyProject.xcodeproj"];
Group* group = [project groupWithPath:@"Main"];
ClassDefinition* classDefinition = [[ClassDefinition alloc] initWithName:@"MyNewClass"];
[classDefinition setHeader:@"<some-header-text>"];
[classDefinition setSource:@"<some-impl-text>"];

[group addClass:classDefinition];
[project save];
```

## Specifying Source File Belongs to Target

```objective-c
File* sourceFile = [project fileWithName:@"MyNewClass.m"];
Target* examples = [project targetWithName:@"Examples"];
[examples addMember:fileResource];
[project save];
```

## Adding a Xib File

This time, we'll use a convenience method on xcode_Group to specify the targets at the same time:

```objective-c
XibDefinition* xibDefinition = [[XibDefinition alloc] initWithName:@"MyXibFile" content:@"<xibXml>"];
[group addXib:xibDefinition toTargets:[project targets]];
[project save];
```

# Docs

The Source/Tests folder contains further usasge examples. A good starting point is to run the test target in Xcode.
This will extract a test project to the /tmp directory, where you'll be able to see the outcome for yourself.

# Building 

## Just the Framework

Open the project in XCode and choose Product/Build. 

## Command-line Build

Includes Unit Tests, Integration Tests, Code Coverge and API reports installed to Xcode. 

### Requirements (one time only)

In addition to Xcode, requires the Appledoc and lcov packages. A nice way to install these is with <a href="http://www.macports.org/install.php">MacPorts</a>.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc.git
sudo install-appledoc.sh
sudo port install lcov
```

NB: Xcode 4.3+ requires command-line tools to be installed separately. 

### Running the build (every other time)

```sh
ant 
```
# Feature Requests and Contributions

. . . are very welcome. 

If you're using the API shoot me an email and tell me what you're doing with it. 

# Compatibility 

Xcode-editor has been tested on Xcode 4+. It should also work on earlier versions of Xcode. The AppCode IDE from
JetBrains is not yet supported.
